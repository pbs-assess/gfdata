\usage{
get_cpue_historical(species = NULL, alt_year_start_date = "04-01",
  areas = c("3[CD]+", "5[AB]+", "5[CDE]+"), end_year = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{Species to filter for positive fishing events. Leave as `NULL`
to include all fishing events. One or more species common names (e.g.
`"pacific ocean perch"`) or one or more species codes (e.g. `396`). Species
codes can be specified as numeric vectors `c(396, 442`) or characters
`c("396", "442")`. Numeric values shorter than 3 digits will be expanded to
3 digits and converted to character objects (`1` turns into `"001"`).
Species common names and species codes should not be mixed. If any element
is missing a species code, then all elements will be assumed to be species
common names.}

\item{alt_year_start_date}{Alternative year starting date specified as a
month-day combination. E.g. "03-01" for March 1st. Can be used to create
'fishing years'.}

\item{areas}{Area groupings as a vector of regular expressions.
See [base::regex()].}

\item{end_year}{Specify the last calendar year to be extracted.}
